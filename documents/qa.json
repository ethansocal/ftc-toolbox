    "question": "Per rule <gs05> robots can’t possess/control more than 2 pixels, and doing so results in a minor penalty for each additional pixel as well as another minor penalty after every 5 seconds.\n\nQ1: We were wondering if there is an exception to be made for intaking a 3rd pixel and immediately spitting it back out.\n\nQ2: Additionally, if such an exception is the case, are there limitations on our actions while the 3rd pixel is in our possession/control? (ex. driving)</gs05>",
    "answer": "A1: Yes there is an exception. The *Robot* in this scenario is unlikely to be *Penalized* for *Controlling* too many *Pixels*. The referee should view the *Robot's* actions as being both *Inadvertent* and *Inconsequential* and not call a rule GS05 *Penalty* as allowed by rule G10.\n\nA2: Yes, for this scenario, there are limitations to being excused for a rule GS05 *Penalty*. The *Robot* is unlikely to receive a rule GS05 *Penalty* if the *Robot* satisfies the following two conditions: 1) It ejects the extra *Pixel* in a reasonable amount of time and; 2) It refrains from playing the game while *Controlling* the extra *Pixel*. Two examples of playing the game are: a) Traveling to a different location and; b) Placing a *Pixel In* a *Scoring Area*. If the *Robot's* actions are clearly focused on removing the extra *Pixel* and not playing other aspects of the game, it is highly unlikely that it will receive a GS05 *Penalty\"."

The Rule GS05c.ii exception is for the movement of three (3) or more of the pre-set stacked *Pixels* as a group that stay *On* the white tape line.\n\nA1: Penalizing the movement of the *Pixel* stack applies when three (3) or more stacked *Pixels* are moved all together *Off* of the white tape line. Moving a \"single *Pixel* from the stack past the tape edge\" is allowed because it is less than the two (2) *Pixel Controller/Possession* limit described in rule GS05.a.\n\nA2: Yes, the rule GS05.c.i exemption applies to any number of *Pixels* knocked off of the stack onto the *Playing Field Floor*.

    "question": "The middle metal poles holding the truss, rigging, and stage door seem to have no way of electrically grounding themselves to outside of the field, so when metal on the robot touches these elements, there is a static discharge that cannot be avoided by teams. <rg01> i) states robots cannot ground themselves to the playing field, and a grounding strap doesn't help. Will there be any rules that ensure competition fields are set up to remove static build-up on these poles?</rg01>",
    "answer": "This may come as a shock (pun intended), but grounding the field may have the opposite effect that you intend. By grounding certain elements of the field you virtually guarantee that ESD shocks will be more intense and more frequent, as there will almost always be a large difference in potential between any floating object sliding/moving on the field (robot, game pieces, etc...) and the grounded elements. Understand also that the common wisdom of “touching metal” also doesn’t apply the same as it may have 5-6 years ago either - realize that virtually all aluminum extrusion on robots today is anodized, which is an electrically non-conducting coating on the extrusion. Older Tetrix anodized aluminum seems to have a thinner anodized layer, so it wears/scratches/rubs off more easily, and thus it was more likely that the aluminum would be electrically conductive and charge-accessible. This means you're not able to consistently rely on \"metal\" to \"electrically connect\" areas around the robot (i.e. thinking of the frame as a “wire” isn’t as applicable). Also the grounding strap is not meant to \"ground\" your robot, it's meant to attempt to equalize the potential between your electronics and areas of static build-up on the robot that the strap is connected to so that when ESD does happen the charge potential is hopefully small and thus has little to no effect. The [Managing ESD](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.html) article on ftc-docs has several recommendations for how teams can protect their robots. No one solution is a silver bullet, though, careful attention is key!\n\nYou’ve asked about what event organizers are doing to reduce ESD buildup on the fields. Heavy Duty Staticide is a staple for treating fields, especially those that are at high risk for static charge buildup like areas with extremely low humidity. This Heavy Duty Staticide has been proven to be extremely effective at significantly reducing (or eliminating) static charge buildup."

    "answer": "Yes, field personnel will strive to maintain the *Team Prop's* orientation when it is repositioned to a different *Spike Mark*. \n\nRandomization relocation is not a precision activity, *Teams* should design their *Team Prop* detection system to tolerate some change in orientation when it is relocated. The *Drive Team* should immediately alert field personnel if there is a significant change in the *Team Prop's* orientation. Using the referee question box after the *Match* ends to alert the Head Referee about a change in *Team Prop* orientation during randomization is too late to affect any *Match* outcome and it is not a justification to replay a *Match*."

I am unable to understand the use of GS05.c.iii.",
    "answer": "Before proceeding with reading the following information, please review the game-specific definitions of the terms *Control*, *Possess*, *Herding*, and *Plowing* in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2. Applying the common or dictionary definitions of any game-specific term in section 4.3 may result in a misunderstanding of a scoring achievement requirement, rule, procedure, etc. Game-specific terms are easy to identify in the Game Manual because they have italics formatting and the first letter is capitalized. For example, the text \"*Control*\" has the correct formatting for a game-specific term. We strive to use this same formatting for defined terms contained in answers to gameplay questions in this forum.\n\nRule GS05.a limits the number of *Pixels* and *Drones* that a *Robot* can legally *Control* or *Possess*. This *Team's* question (!Q50) asks for an example of where *Plowing* through 3/4/5 *Pixels* does not violate rule GS05.a. The definition of *Control* specifically states that *Plowing* is not a form of *Control*. Therefore, all *Plowing* actions by a *Robot* do not violate the *Scoring Element Control/Possession* rule, GS05.a.\n\nThe second part of this *Team's* question asks for a *Plowing* scenario that is not *Herding*. Since *Plowing* actions and *Herding* actions are mutually exclusive, all *Plowing* actions are not *Herding*\".\n\nThe following are gameplay examples that may be helpful:\n\nExample 1: A *Robot* collects two *Pixels* from a *Pixel* stack. Since these are the only *Pixels Possessed* or *Controlled* by the *Robot*, rule GS05.a is not violated. The *Robot* drives directly through the *Truss* or *Stage Door* and stops *In* their *Alliance's Backstage*. Along the way to the *Backstage*, a stray *Pixel* on the *Playing Field Floor* is pushed by the *Robot* and it winds up *In* the *Backstage*. The *Robot* has now violated rule GS05.a because it *Possesses* two *Pixels* and it *Controlled* (*Herded*) the stray *Pixel* for a total of three (3) *Controlled Pixels*. The stray *Pixel* was *Herded* because it was moved to a location that provided the *Alliance* a strategic advantage since it was *Scored In* the *Backstage*.\n\nExample 2: Same as Example 1, except when the *Robot* encounters the stray *Pixel*, it pushes the stray *Pixel* for a short distance. The *Drive Team* quickly realizes that the *Robot* just started to *Control* too many *Pixels*.  The *Drive Team* changes the *Robot's* direction of travel so that the *Robot* sheds the stray *Pixel*, leaving it behind on the *Playing Field Floor* while the *Robot* continues on its way to the *Backstage*. In this example, the stray *Pixel* was *Plowed* (i.e, it was not moved into a location that gave the *Alliance* a strategic advantage). Therefore, rule GS05.a is not violated.\n\nIf there is still uncertainty about how *Controlling*, *Possessing*, *Herding*, and *Plowing* apply to rule GS05, the Head Referee at your next competition will be happy to answer your questions during the *Drivers Meeting.* Demonstrating gameplay scenarios on a *Playing Field* is an excellent way to gain understanding of how to apply rules to complex scenarios.\n\n**Pro Tip:** *Drive Teams* have an obligation while driving their *Robots* around the *Playing Field* to avoid *Controlling* stray *Pixels* that would cause the *Robot* to violate rule GS05. In other words, *Robots* should maneuver around stray *Pixels* if their *Herding* would cause the *Robot* to exceed the allowed number of *Controlled Pixels*.\n\n**Warning:** Deliberately placing *Pixels* in locations on the *Playing Field Floor* to use rule GS05.a constraints as a strategy to increase the difficulty for an opposing *Alliance Robot* to move around the *Playing Field* violates rule G29."

    "answer": "A1: In general, a curved glide path is allowed.\n\nA2: The Game Manual does not specify a lateral (wide) trajectory constraint. The geometry of the gameplay area is the practical limitation for the *Drone* trajectory. The eighteen (18) ft. long and five (5) ft. high *Drone* trajectory limits described in rule RG07 will be enforced.\n\nA3: A *Drone* is allowed to exit the *Playing Field* in any direction. There are consequences if the *Drone* impacts something *Outside* the *Playing Field Wall* as described in rules GS11.g.iii, GS11.g.iv, GS11.g.v., and S1 if there is a safety hazard.\n\n**Note 1:** *Drone* trajectory strategies that exit the *Playing Field Perimeter* other than through the audience edge of the *Playing Field Wall* do so at their own risk. \n\n**Note 2:** A *Drone* impacting a *Drive Team* member of either *Alliance* in a manner that is not interference (i.e., the *Drive Team* member was not able to avoid being hit) should be treated as a *Scoring Element* out of bounds and returned to the owning *Alliance's Pixel Storage* at the earliest, safe opportunity."

An object that is entirely within the upwards vertical extension of a defined *Area’s* boundary is *Completely Inside* the *Area*. The boundary element (tape, wall, markings, etc.) is part of the *Area* for the purposes of determining *Inside* and *Outside*, unless otherwise specified.\"\n\nThe *Autonomous Navigation* task requirements are satisfied if the *Robot* is *Parked* (i.e., motionless) and any portion of the *Robot* has crossed into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right angle to the *Playing Field Floor*) of the *Backstage* taped boundary.\n\n**Pro Tip:** The scoring referee has a short period of time between the end of the *Autonomous Period* and the start of the *Driver-Controlled Period* to record all of the *Autonomous Period Scoring* tasks. *Teams* can help the scoring referee accurately record an *Alliance's* scoring tasks by designing their *Autonomous* software so that their *Robot* is unambiguously *In* the *Backstage* at the end of the period."

For clarification, we wanted to pose another case: during initialization (both during inspection &amp; pre-game) could we have the motors that power our lift move so that the lift is raised to a specific height? In this instance, the motor is not stalling: it is running to a position and then holding that position, the same way a servo holds its position while the robot is initialized.",
    "answer": "Motors and servos \"hold position\" very differently. Motors with a load applied to their motor shaft can \"hold position\" through mechanical friction (via a gearbox/gear train) or through stalling. Servos with a load applied to their splines generally only \"hold position\" through stalling.

    "answer": "No, a *Robot* that is *In* a *Tile's* interlocking teeth is *In* more than one *Tile*. The *Pre-Match Robot* set up requirement is that the *Robot* is *Completely In* only one (1) of the required *Tiles*. See section 4.4.1 item #3 in Game Manual Part 2 for all of the *Pre-Match Robot* set up requirements."

    "question": "When flexible (easily bends) tubing is installed on the robot for intake, can the tubing extend slightly (1/2 inch) beyond the 18-inch boundary of the robot?",
    "answer": "The maximum size of the Robot for starting a Match is 18 inches (wide by 18 inches  long by 18 inches high. However, per Rule RG02 b allows for flexible materials surgical tubing to extend up to 0.25 inches (0.635 cm) beyond the 18 inch size constraint. A 1/2\" extension is outside of the allowable margin.  Consider tucking it in at startup, once the Match starts Robots may expand beyond the starting size constraint."

    "question": "Can you confirm that the following sensor would be legal.\nhttps://www.adafruit.com/product/2168\n\nIts an optical break beam sensor we would like to connect to a digital input on the control hub, can function on either 3.3V or 5V (We understand that for 5V you need Logic Level Converter)",
    "answer": "In general, it is not possible for us to rule on the legality of all potential sensors.  When determining the legality of a particular sensor, apply the constraints imposed by RE11 as a guide to legality.\n\nIn this particular case, the \"sensor\" you are asking about is in two distinct parts; an IR LED emitter and a IR detector.\n\nAs long as the IR emitter is connected and powered in accordance with RE12 and the IR detector meets the constraints of RE11, the combination would be allowed"

    "question": "Ref. <g11>, Q125, &amp; Q111, Drive Team communication to Robot, for signaling to the Human Player. <g11> permits use of the Driver Station for “operating the robot”. Is it still legal, if its purpose is to signal the Human Player?  e.g.:  A Driver Station command causes a Robot-mounted servo to raise a colored semaphore flag, or illuminate an indicator light on the Robot. The Human Player sees this signal, and selects a colored pixel to place in the wing, based on the color of the flag, or light.</g11></g11>",
    "answer": "The action described is legal, provided that the signaling device does not distract or interfere with an opposing *Alliance Drive Team* per rules RE12.b, and G16.c."

Q1: Can the starting sheet of paper be an irregular shape as long as it is smaller than 8.5x11 and a single piece?  Q2: During construction, can pieces of the paper be trimmed with scissors and discarded - final drone is still single sheet.  Q3: Can the drone have holes cut or punched in the paper assuming the cut-outs are discarded.",
    "answer": "A1: Yes, the starting size of the paper can be any shape as long as it is equal to or smaller than 8 1/2 x 11 or A4.\nA2: Yes, the paper can be trimmed as long as the cut off parts are discarded.\nA3: Yes, holes may be cut out of the paper."

    "question": "The answers to Q18 and Q78 make sense to me, but Q155 seems confusing related to a match I saw on webcast. A robot was still touching the ground at 0:00 when the buzzer started and the robot only left the floor while the buzzer was sounding. The definition of \"Scored at the End of the Period\" makes me think this would not count as a suspended robot, but Q155 makes me think it might.",
    "answer": "Thank you for identifying the inconsistency between the answers to !Q18 and !Q155. !Q18 was updated on November 6, 2023 to include \nthe end of *Match* scoring system buzzer length is a \"grace period\" for completing the *End Game Suspension* task."

Q1: Is the opposing alliance stack close to their wing / human player or is it the stack closest to their spike marks? Q2: During the driver-controlled period can a robot knock over the pre-placed white pixels in the opposing alliances half of the playing field? Q3: during autonomous can the robot knock over the pre-placed white pixels closest to our spike marks?",
    "answer": "A1: The answer that you seek is found by reading rule GS03.a. Rule GS03.a states in part: \"*Tiles* A, B, C constitute the blue side of the *Playing Field*, *Tiles* D, E, F constitute the red side of the *Playing Field*.\" *Tile* location nomenclature is described in Game Manual Part 2 Appendix B. Therefore, each *Alliance's* half of the *Playing Field* contains three (3) *Pixel Stacks*.\n\nThe *Pixel Stacks* in *Tiles* B1, B1/C1, and C1 are on the blue *Alliance's* half of the *Playing Field*. *Pixel Stacks* in *Tiles* D1, D1/E1, and E1 are on the red *Alliance's* half of the *Playing Field*.\n\nA2: We believe that !Q112 answers your question.\n\nA3: We believe that !Q112 answers your question."

    "question": "Q141 says \"No sharing of GND or 3.3v wiring.\" (full stop), which inspectors or officials could read more broadly than we think is intended. We seek to clarify Q141's answer. The analog/digital ports are designed to support two sensor inputs per physical port, e.g. using a REV-31-1386 sensor splitter cable. Q1: Can two or more sensors connected to a common digital/analog physical port share its GND/3.3v wires? Q2: Can multiple I2C devices sharing a common I2C port (bus) share its GND/3.3v wires?",
    "answer": "!Q141 was meant to clarify that the power/ground bus used by sensors/pathways to provide signals should be scoped to the ports/connectors that provided it. For example, Digital Connector 0/1 on the Control Hub provides a power/ground plane intended to be used to power sensors/pathways to provide a signal for Digital Channel 0 and/or Digital Channel 1 - not for a device/pathway providing signal to Digital Channel 2 nor for Analog Channel 0, and certainly not for powering an I2C device chain."

    "answer": "A1:Per Rule DR05b, the oil-based paint version of the Sharpie is not allowed.  \nA2: The standard Sharpie Permanent Marker is legal. \n\nRemember, the reason for requiring a Team Number is so that Drones can be returned to the Teams post Match.  Any attempt to \"game the rules\" by adding weight by the use of excess ink or other marking materials will result in the Drone being disallowed."

    "question": "RE13.b.ii specifies that Vision Cameras can connect to REV Control Hub (Robot Controller) using a \"powered USB hub\", but doesn't mention allowed power sources for the USB hub. RE14.c.ii mentions energy sources for a powered USB hub, but RE14 also says \"smartphone\" robot controller device and RE14.c.ii refers only to connecting the hub to an Expansion Hub USB. Thus RE14 perhaps excludes the Control Hub USB. Q: Can a USB hub connected to a Control Hub be powered by sources listed in RE14.c.ii?",
