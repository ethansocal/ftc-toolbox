## üöÄ About Us

Hey! We are Efe and Ethan, a couple of robotics enthusiasts who found ourselves bored from sifting through pages of the game manual for every small question we had. That's when the lightbulb went off - let's build an AI Chatbot to do it for us!

We got to work and created the FTC Toolbox, initially just for our team. But guess what? It worked fantastically! It made things so much easier for us that we thought, why not share this handy tool with everyone? And so, here we are, hoping FTC Toolbox can be as much of a game-changer for your team as it has been for ours.

Welcome to our project - we are super excited to have you on board!
